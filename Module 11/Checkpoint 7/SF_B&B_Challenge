What's the most expensive listing? What else can you tell me about the listing?
ANSWER: Full House Victorian is the most expensive listing. I thought it was interesting that there is only one review a month and the availability between the most expensive and the second most expensive is 67 days different. (The most expensive is least available.)
QUERY
SELECT 
	name, 
	MAX(price) AS Highest_Price,
	reviews_per_month, 
	availability_365
FROM sfo_listings
GROUP BY 3,4,1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 5;

What neighborhoods seem to be the most popular?
There are over 600 neighborhoods with 0 zero days available per year. Among them these have the most reviews:
1.	Perfectly located Castro - 365
2.	Bunk Bed in the Treat Street Clubhouse – 310
3.	Vibrant Master Bedroom/Private Bathroom + Parking - 273
QUERY
SELECT 
  	DISTINCT name, 
  	sum(number_of_reviews) AS Number_of_Reviews
FROM sfo_listings
WHERE availability_365 LIKE '0'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

What time of year is the cheapest time to go to San Francisco? What about the busiest?

For this question I created a table, inserted the sfo_calender table that had data about dates, availability, and price. I created a column capturing 2 months for a season and used the average cost of listing per season to determine the “cheapest time to go” and highest proportion of rooms available / total rooms open for that season to determine the “busiest” season. 
Ironically, Jan-Feb was the least expensive time to go on average and time where most of the B&B’s available were occupied.
