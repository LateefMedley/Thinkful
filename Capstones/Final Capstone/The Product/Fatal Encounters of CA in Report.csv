The police entered the premises and found Michael Sanders, who appeared disoriented, standing unclothed and behind his wife, Lavette Sanders. The officers decided to subdue Michael Sanders by firing tasers at his naked body, although Fresno Police Department rules and other instructions require that tasers not come in contact with human skin. The officers fired numerous taser darts into Michael Sanders's body. The officers then handcuffed Sanders, placed him face down on a gurney, which suffocated him, and then placed him in an ambulance. Sanders ultimately stopped breathing.

Jenkins reportedly shot himself inside his fiancee's home while federal agents were outside the front door. Jenkins was a Camp Pendleton Marine who had reportedly gone AWOL and was suspected of armed robbery, theft, carjacking, kidnapping and attempted sexual assault. Investigators tracked Jenkins to the Oceanside apartment after officials said a San Diego County Sheriff's Department deputy and a federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent assigned to the San Diego Regional Fugitive Task Force recognized him from a wanted poster. At about 8:30 a.m., police knocked on the door. Jenkins reportedly pushed his fiancee into a bedroom, shut the door and shot himself in the head. Declaring Jenkins a deserter, the Marine Corps had initially denied his mother death benefits. The decision was later overturned by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, which found Jenkins' erratic behavior and suicide were caused by untreated PTSD. In a report, investigator Thomas Ferguson called Jenkins a ""salvageable"" Marine who deserved better from the Corps.",Ruled suicide,Suicide,http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2005/sep/29/awol-marine-apparently-shoots-self-police-say/,Unknown
