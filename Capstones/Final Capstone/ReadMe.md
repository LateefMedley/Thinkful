    - Does not include civilians who died in law enforcement custody

### The Purpose

The goal of this work is to provide a look into what has happened regarding civilian fatal encounters with police over the last 20 years by region and to predict what may happen based on the trends and seasonality we have already observed. It is my hope that this information will enlighten civilians and law enforcement, and overseeing agencies of the risk of ignoring problems in policing, not only as it pertains to minority groups, but as it pertains to all the stakeholders regarding the crucial work of policing. These encounters, when negatively viewed by the public makes the line of this work more dangerous, but comprehensive reporting and analytics regarding this matter on a national scale is scarce. That may be because there are over 10,000 law enforcement agencies and major inconsistencies in reporting which lends itself to the unhealthy narrative of secrecy regarding public policing. “Secrecy in police work is not only undesirable but unwarranted. Accountability means being responsive to the problems and needs of citizens. It also means managing police resources in the most cost-effective manner. It must be remembered that the power to police comes from the consent of those being policed.” The Community Relations Service (CRS), component of the U.S. Department of Justice.

Quick Note about the availability of this data 

“The nation’s leading law enforcement agency [FBI] collects vast amounts of information on crime nationwide, but missing from this clearinghouse are statistics on where, how often, and under what circumstances police use deadly force. In fact, no one anywhere comprehensively tracks the most significant act police can do in the line of duty: take a life,” according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal in its series Deadly Force (Nov. 28, 2011) During my search for this data I can say that some summary statistics are availible to the public, but I had a hard time finding a tabular form of encounters. 

Fatal Encounter’s word about the data

The data I am using comes from the non-profit “fatal-encounters.org.” Here’s a note from their website, “A quick word about the data: At over 28,000 records, it’s tempting to consider this a comprehensive dataset. It’s not. While we completed the systematic states-by-year searches of the United States on November 3, 2017, we know we’ve missed some. This set was never intended to do anything except identify the names, demographic information, dates and locales of the dead and to give us direction for categories that needed further research.”
