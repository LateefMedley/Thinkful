Also, when you're done, compare your work to [these example solutions](https://github.com/Thinkful-Ed/machine-learning-regression-problems/blob/master/notebooks/5.solution_evaluating_goodness_of_fit.ipynb).\n",

    "For this assignment, you'll revisit the historical temperature dataset. To complete this assignment, submit a link a Jupyter notebook containing your solutions to the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* First, load the dataset from the **weatherinszeged** table from Thinkful's database.\n",
    "* Like in the previous checkpoint, build a linear regression model where your target variable is the difference between the *apparenttemperature* and the *temperature*. As explanatory variables, use *humidity* and *windspeed*. Now, estimate your model using OLS. What are the R-squared and adjusted R-squared values? Do you think they are satisfactory? Why? \n",
    "* Next, include the interaction of *humidity* and *windspeed* to the model above and estimate the model using OLS. Now, what is the R-squared of this model? Does this model improve upon the previous one? \n",
    "* Add *visibility* as an additional explanatory variable to the first model and estimate it. Did R-squared increase? What about adjusted R-squared? Compare the differences put on the table by the interaction term and the *visibility* in terms of the improvement in the adjusted R-squared. Which one is more useful?\n",
    "* Choose the best one from the three models above with respect to their AIC and BIC scores. Validate your choice by discussing your justification with your mentor.\n",
