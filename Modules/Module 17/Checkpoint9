Assignment 

Try to model the result of a coin toss. In your model, including any features that you think important in explaining the result. Discuss with your mentor about the pros and cons of adding too many features into your model.

The features that could influence the result of a coin toss include: 
•	Position of the coin prior to the flip
•	Surface the coin lands on
•	Was the coin forcefully stopped?
•	Wind speed
•	Heads or Tails?
A pro for having a lot of features, in the beginning, is more information about the event we are trying to get insight into. 
A con is that we will need to reduce the number of vectors and choose from the best ones unless we are not planning to do something
that will be computationally heavy on our computers. 

If you ever used Netflix, you should already have realized that it provides some recommendations for you to watch. 
In data science, this is an example of the so-called **recommendations systems**. 
Read this nontechnical blog post of [Netflix](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/100639) about how they model their recommendations systems.
Then, derive the features they use in their recommendations engines and discuss what else can be incorporated into this model.

Features:
•	Taste profile
•	Recently watched
•	Rated titles
•	Others that rated title similarly
•	Genre
•	Release date
•	Actors
•	Time of day you watch
•	The device used for streaming
•	Time spent watching a trailer 
•	Time spent watching title
•	Watchlist

They also mention 3 “layers” of personalization that could be using a combination of features and weights based on rows being 
displayed or re-engineered features from the dataset. If sign in with a Facebook or other social media account is available, 
data from those services can be used to drive interesting titles to the viewer.
