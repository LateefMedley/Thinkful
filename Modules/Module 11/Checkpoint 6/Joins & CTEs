What are the three longest trips on rainy days?

SELECT 
	trips.duration,
	weather.events 
FROM
	trips
JOIN
	weather
ON
	trips.zip_code = weather.zip
WHERE
	events LIKE 'rain'
ORDER BY 1 DESC
LIMIT 3;


Which station is full most often?

If “full most often” is the same as “having 0 docks available most often” then 3 stations fit this criteria. 
They found with the following query. 

SELECT 
	station_id, 
	COUNT(docks_available = 0)
FROM status
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 3;


Return a list of stations with a count of number of trips starting at that station but ordered by dock count.

SELECT 
	stations.name,
	COUNT(trips.start_station) AS trips_per_station,
	stations.dockcount
FROM
	trips
JOIN
	stations
ON
	trips.start_station = stations.name
GROUP BY 3,1;

(Challenge) What's the length of the longest trip for each day it rains anywhere?
WITH rainy AS (
SELECT
	date,
	events,
	zip
FROM
	weather
WHERE 
	events LIKE 'Rain')
SELECT
	rainy.date,
	rainy.events,
	MAX(trips.duration) AS Longest_Trip,
	zip
FROM
	rainy
JOIN
	trips
ON
	rainy.zip = trips.zip_code
GROUP BY 1,2,4;
